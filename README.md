# BDA301
Course Materials: Introduction to Business Data Analytics of Large Scale Data

This consists of lecture notes from my own course on BDA, taking the opportunity to also teach the much in-demand Python.

Course Description: 

An introduction to the analysis techniques that can applied to large scale data sets. Focused on teaching data analysis skills in a fun and engaging environment. Structured to engage students in direct hands-on analysis and to broaden the skills sets that are generally provided by the undergraduate programs in Business, Accounting and Economics. Students from outside of the Business School fields are welcomed to attend and should provide documentation of their level of computational preparation.

Introduction:
This semester we will be covering introductory data analytics. The majority of skills will be taught in Python, particularly summary statistics, figure generation, and early predictive techniques from regression to classification. 

Upon completion of BDA 301, students should be able to:
•	Create basic data displays (figures and summary statistics) in Python.
•	Manipulate basic data.
•	Perform simple prediction with multiple techniques.
•	Use more advanced computer software such as Python or others (GIS) to produce regression results.
